It is simple POC react CLI which works with structure from [cra-template-poc](https://github.com/Feridum/cra-template-poc)

To install:

`
 npm i react-cli-poc -g
`

For now there are available two commands: 
 - react-cli-poc i <name> (react-cli-poc init <name>) - create new project using create-react-app and custom template
 - react-cli-poc gr (react-cli-poc generate-route) - ask question about route path and component name and create components in screen directory and update routes file
